# Pokemon Battle Agent

- Leaving off setting up pokemon-showdown docker container
- Trying to do this on a docker container, realizing that the team sets up on windows
- Currently getting the following error: glibc 2.29 not found on my docker image
- Saw something that indicated it's only available on debian bullseye, may try to switch to this docker image to fix the issue.
